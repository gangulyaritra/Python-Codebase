        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) [**[Wikipedia]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. OOPs, structure a software program into a simple, reusable piece of code blueprints (usually called classes) used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. The basic concepts of OOPs are:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Class\n",
        "*   Object\n",
        "*   Method\n",
        "*   Abstraction\n",
        "*   Inheritance\n",
        "*   Encapsulation\n",

        "The class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.\n",

        "*   Classes are created by the keyword `class`.\n",
        "*   Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.\n",

Inheritance creates a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called the derived (or child) class, and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class. Inheritance allows classes to inherit features of other classes. The benefit of inheritance is to create a generic parent class and then create more specific child classes as needed.\n",

Attributes and behaviors are defined by code inside the class template. Then, when an object is instantiated from the class, the data and methods are encapsulated in that object. Encapsulation hides the internal software code implementation inside a class and hides the internal data of inside objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOPs). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. Encapsulation puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object's variable can only be changed by an object's method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",

That is, Protected Members are only accessible to child classes. To accomplish this in Python, we need to follow the convention by prefixing the name of the member by a **single underscore \"_\"**.\n",
        "*   **Private members** are similar to protected members, but the difference is that the class members declared private should neither be accessed outside the class nor by any base class. Private members can only be accessed from within that class. In Python, there is no existence of Private instance variables that cannot be accessed except inside a class. However, to define a private member, prefix the member name with **double underscore \"__\"**.\n",

        "*   **Adds Security:** Only public methods and attributes are accessible from the outside.\n",

        "*   **Protects IP:** Code is hidden inside a class, and only public methods are accessible by the outside developers.\n",

        "Here, we see that the methods such as $\\_\\_str\\_\\_()$, which have not been overridden in the child classes, are used from the parent class. Due to polymorphism, the Python interpreter automatically recognizes that the **fact()** method for object **a** ($Square$ class) is overridden. So, it uses the one defined in the child class. On the contrary, since the **fact()** method for object **b** isn't overridden, it is used from the Parent $Shape$ class.\n",
