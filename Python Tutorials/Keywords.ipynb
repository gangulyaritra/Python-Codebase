        "\n",
        "In Python, Assertions are the debugging tools that help in the smooth flow of code. Assertions are assumptions that a programmer knows always wants to be true and hence puts them in code so that failure of them doesn't allow the code to execute further. In simpler terms, assertion is the boolean expression that checks if the statement is True or False. Python provides the assert statement to check if a given logical expression is True or False. Program execution proceeds only if the expression is True and raises the `AssertionError` when the statement is False (i.e., it stops the execution of the program).\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Assert keywords in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the assert keyword helps in achieving this task. This statement takes input a boolean condition, which when returns True doesnâ€™t return anything. But if this statement is False, then it raises an `AssertionError` along with the optional message provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python has a built-in `assert` statement to use assertion conditions in the program. The `assert` statement has a condition or expression which is supposed to be always True. If the condition is False, assert halts the program and gives an `AssertionError`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Syntax for using Assert in Python:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `assert <condition>`\n",
        "*   `assert <condition>, <error message>` **(Optional)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**In Python, we can use `assert` statements in two ways.**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The `assert` statement has a condition. If that condition is not satisfied, the program will stop and give the `AssertionError`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  The `assert` statement can also have a condition and an optional error message. If the condition is not satisfied, assert stops the program and gives `AssertionError` along with the error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parameters.**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **condition:** The boolean condition returns True or False.\n",
        "2.  **error message:** The optional argument gets printed in the console in the case of `AssertionError`.\n",
        "3.  **Returns:** Returns `AssertionError`, in case the condition evaluates to False along with the error message provided.\n",

        "\n",
        "$Yield$ is a keyword in Python used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable, and when the function gets called, the execution starts from the last yield statement. Any function that contains a `yield` keyword is termed as a generator. Hence, yield is what makes a generator. The `yield` keyword in Python is less known but has a greater utility than one can think of.\n",

        "**`yield` is used inside a function as a `return` statement. But `yield` returns a generator.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The generator is an iterator that generates one item at a time. A large list of values will take up a lot of memory. Generators are useful in this situation as it generates only one value at a time instead of storing all the values in memory.\n",

        "#### **Advantages of $Yield$:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Since it stores the local variable states, hence overhead of memory allocation is controlled.\n",
        "*   Since the old state is retained, the flow doesn't start from the beginning and hence saves time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Disadvantages of $Yield$:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Sometimes, the use of yield becomes erroneous if the calling of function is not handled properly.\n",

If we don't have any logging records and our program crashes, then there are few chances to detect the cause of the problem. And even if we detect the cause of the error, it will consume a lot of time. Therefore with logging, we can leave a trail of breadcrumbs so that if some error occurs, we can determine the cause of the problem.\n",

It may solve the issues for simple scripts, but for complex scripts, the printing approach will fail. Python has a built-in module logging which allows writing status messages to a file or any other output streams.
